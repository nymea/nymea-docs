## nymea-cli

The *nymea-cli* command-line interface is an admin tool written in Python to communicate with the [*nymea*](https://github.com/nymea/nymea) [JSONRPC API](raw-api) and test functionality of *nymea*.

The nymea-cli does *not* provide a python library ready to be used at this point. Instead it should be seen as an example of
how to interact with nymea using python.

If you're a python developer, we'd happily accept any patches that transform nymea-cli into a library and a frontend part.

The code can be obtained from [github](https://github.com/nymea/nymea-cli).

```bash
git clone https://github.com/nymea/nymea-cli
```
