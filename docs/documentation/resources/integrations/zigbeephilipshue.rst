Hue lights
----------


Most of the lights and lamps from Philips Hue should be handled in a generic way by the ``nymea-plugin-zigbee-generic-lights`` plugin. There are 2 methods for bringing a Hue light / bulb into the nymea ZigBee network.

1. Use a `Hue dimmer switch <https://www.philips-hue.com/en-us/p/hue-dimmer-switch--latest-model-/046677562779>`__ (most reliable):


::

   * Open the ZigBee network in nymea for allowing new devices to join the network.

::

   * Switch the lamp off for a few seconds by cutting the power and turn it back on again.

::

   * On the Hue dimmer switch, press and hold the `On` and the `Off` keys (on newer models the `Hue` and the `Power` key) simultaneously.

::

   * Hold the switch as close as possible to the lamp while keep pressing both buttons.

::

   * Keep holding and pressing the buttons until the lamp has blinked 3 times and fades back to the normal mode.

::

   * Now release the buttons on the remote, the lamp should be resetted and start joining the nymea ZigBee network.


2. Remove the lamp from an existing Hue Bridge setup:


::

   * Open the ZigBee network in nymea for allowing new devices to join the network.

::

   * Remove the lamp from the Hue Bridge using the official Hue App or nymea.

::

   * The lamp should now be resetted and start joining the nymea ZigBee network.


3. Reset the lamp by power cutting several times:


::

   * Open the ZigBee network in nymea for allowing new devices to join the network.

::

   * Cut the lamps power supply for a second and then turn it back on. (Either wia a wall switch that cuts the circuit or by unscrewing the bulb)

::

   * Repeat the previous step seven times.

::

   * The lamp should now be resetted and start joinging the nymea ZigBee network.


Requirements
------------


* A compatible ZigBee controller and a running ZigBee network in nymea. You can find more information about supported controllers and ZigBee network configurations `here <https://nymea.io/documentation/users/usage/configuration#zigbee>`__.
